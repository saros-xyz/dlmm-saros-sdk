## Abstract
Prediction markets are experiencing a fundamental transformation from simple binary betting to sophisticated forecasting platforms that aggregate collective intelligence. This analysis establishes a comprehensive technical framework for classifying prediction platforms across six critical dimensions and examines Trepa's groundbreaking precision-based approach. Our research reveals that while traditional binary markets like Polymarket dominate current adoption, Trepa's hybrid resolution mechanism with accuracy-based continuous payouts represents a paradigm shift toward intellectually rigorous forecasting systems that reward analytical skill over speculative gambling.

## 1. The Prediction Market Evolution
Traditional prediction markets operate on winner-take-all binary models where participants either receive full payouts for correct predictions or lose everything. This approach has fundamental limitations: it discourages careful analysis, fails to capture nuanced thinking, and essentially functions as sophisticated gambling rather than genuine forecasting.

Trepa fundamentally disrupts this model by implementing accuracy-based rewards for numerical forecasts on economic indicators like inflation rates, employment data, and bond yields. Instead of binary win/lose outcomes, users receive proportional rewards based on prediction precision - predicting 3.2% inflation when the actual result is 3.1% earns substantial rewards, while a 2.8% prediction still receives meaningful payouts.

This evolution reflects broader trends toward skill-based digital platforms and the growing demand for sophisticated risk management tools in an increasingly uncertain economic environment.

## 2. Technical Classification Framework

### 2.1 Resolution Mechanisms: How Truth is Determined
- **Oracle-Based Resolution**: Automated systems using external data feeds like price APIs or government statistics. Polymarket exemplifies this approach, automatically resolving markets using reliable data sources. Benefits include speed and objectivity, but limitations include vulnerability to data manipulation and inability to handle subjective outcomes.
- **Human Review Resolution**: Manual verification by designated reviewers or community voting. While flexible for complex scenarios, these systems face scalability constraints, potential bias, and higher operational costs.
- **Hybrid Resolution**: Advanced systems combining automation with human oversight, like UMA Protocol's optimistic oracle mechanism. These assume data accuracy unless challenged, creating economic incentives for dispute resolution while maintaining efficiency.

### 2.2 Infrastructure Architecture
- **On-Chain Platforms**: Fully decentralized systems operating entirely on blockchain networks. Trepa leverages Solana's high throughput and sub-cent transaction costs to enable frequent predictions and micropayments. This infrastructure choice is critical for supporting continuous, low-friction forecasting.
- **Off-Chain Systems**: Traditional centralized platforms offering superior performance but sacrificing decentralization benefits.
- **Hybrid Architectures**: Platforms balancing decentralization with usability through Layer 2 solutions or sidechains.

### 2.3 Prediction Formats
- **Binary/Categorical Markets**: Simple yes/no or multiple-choice predictions dominating platforms like Polymarket and Augur. While conceptually simple, they fail to capture probabilistic thinking or partial accuracy.
- **Scalar/Continuous Predictions**: Numerical range or exact value predictions. Trepa specializes here, enabling specific predictions on inflation rates, employment percentages, or bond yields. This format requires sophisticated scoring but provides granular information aggregation.
- **Probabilistic Distributions**: Advanced systems allowing full probability distribution submissions rather than point estimates.

### 2.4 Scoring and Incentive Mechanisms
- **All-or-Nothing Payouts**: Traditional binary systems where winners take all. Simple to understand but discourages analytical thinking.
- **Accuracy-Based Scoring**: Trepa's innovation: proportional rewards based on prediction precision using modified scoring rules. This encourages careful analysis while reducing gambling aspects.
- **Market Scoring Rules**: Sophisticated mechanisms like the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) providing continuous liquidity while maintaining truth-telling incentives.
